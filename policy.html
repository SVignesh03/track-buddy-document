                We value the security of your financial and budget data. Track-Buddy performs backups of your information,
                including financial transactions and budget details using Google Drive. These backups are stored on your
                personal Google Drive, and as the developer, we do not have access to this data. While we make every
                effort to maintain data integrity, it's important to understand that we cannot guarantee against loss or
                corruption. To ensure an additional layer of protection, we recommend maintaining an independent backup
                of your data. Your use of the budget tracking application signifies your acceptance of this backup
                policy.
            </p>
            <p>

                other preferences. This information is not shared with the developer, unless explicitly shared with the
                developer.
